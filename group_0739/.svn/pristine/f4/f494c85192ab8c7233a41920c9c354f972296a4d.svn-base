Minutes for Planning Meeting 11/23/15:

We all met to discuss how we were going to implement this phase of the project. 
It was decided that we would all meet together on Friday and attempt to finish this phase in one go
as we had trouble finding a good way to divide the work and everyone was on board with this idea.
In addition, we had very few changes to make to our design from pII, so most of our time would be spent
designing the app in Android Studio.
Changes that need to be made to pII code:
Allow admin to search for itineraries
Allow admin to book itinerary for client
Add numSeats variable to flights and keep track of fullness of flights - make sure that flight is never overbooked
Create password file and add login check for clients vs. admins.

Next meeting scheduled for: 11/27/15

Minutes for Status Meeting 11/27/15:

We met for a meeting/work session.  After some configuration we found out that only Adam's version of Android Studio
was fully functioning.  As a result, we were working on one computer for the duration of the meeting. 
We managed to successfully import all our java files from eclipse into android studio and transitioned from a login
screen to a home screen for the admin by checking whether the password entered was valid.  We also created a new admin
if there was not already one in the infocentre.  We ran into problems when we tried to enter flight info from a file.
We originally could not find the directory that the file was being sent to.  After we fixed that error, we found the file
on the emulator but were unable to pull the file onto the computer as android studio gave the message that the file was null.
After attempting to fix this problem for two hours, we decided to go to office hours and ask for assistance.  The next meeting was 
scheduled for 11/30/15 with the knowledge that Adam would likely not be able to attend due to committments to another course.
To complete for next meeting:
H - ask about file issue during next office hours
J,D - research how to use various android studio items so we can figure out how to best display the data
A - research using a list view to display and edit flights
J,D,H - ensure that the comitted app runs on their versions of Android Studio

Note: As a team we realized that the file error was standing in our way of quickly completing the entire program.
Once we can get the flight information into the system, connecting the app to the back-end proved fairly straightforward for the 
parts that we already completed. In addition, completing the client side of the app is very similar to the admin side, but with
fewer responsibilities.
