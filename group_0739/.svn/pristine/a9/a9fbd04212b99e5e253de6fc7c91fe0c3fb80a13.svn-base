Minutes for Planning Meeting 11/23/15:

We all met to discuss how we were going to implement this phase of the project. 
It was decided that we would all meet together on Friday and attempt to finish this phase in one go
as we had trouble finding a good way to divide the work and everyone was on board with this idea.
In addition, we had very few changes to make to our design from pII, so most of our time would be spent
designing the app in Android Studio.
Changes that need to be made to pII code:
Allow admin to search for itineraries
Allow admin to book itinerary for client
Add numSeats variable to flights and keep track of fullness of flights - make sure that flight is never overbooked
Create password file and add login check for clients vs. admins.

Next meeting scheduled for: 11/27/15

Minutes for Status Meeting 11/27/15:

We met for a meeting/work session.  After some configuration we found out that only Adam's version of Android Studio
was fully functioning.  As a result, we were working on one computer for the duration of the meeting. 
We managed to successfully import all our java files from eclipse into android studio and transitioned from a login
screen to a home screen for the admin by checking whether the password entered was valid.  We also created a new admin
if there was not already one in the infocentre.  We ran into problems when we tried to enter flight info from a file.
We originally could not find the directory that the file was being sent to.  After we fixed that error, we found the file
on the emulator but were unable to pull the file onto the computer as android studio gave the message that the file was null.
After attempting to fix this problem for two hours, we decided to go to office hours and ask for assistance.  The next meeting was 
scheduled for 11/30/15 with the knowledge that Adam would likely not be able to attend due to commitments to another course.
To complete for next meeting:
H - ask about file issue during next office hours
J,D - research how to use various android studio items so we can figure out how to best display the data
A - research using a list view to display and edit flights
J,D,H - ensure that the committed app runs on their versions of Android Studio

Note: As a team we realized that the file error was standing in our way of quickly completing the entire program.
Once we can get the flight information into the system, connecting the app to the back-end proved fairly straightforward for the 
parts that we already completed. In addition, completing the client side of the app is very similar to the admin side, but with
fewer responsibilities.  

Minutes for Status Meeting 11/30/15:

Adam was able to attend the meeting, but Darshan had an emergency and was unable to come.  We managed to finish everything
we wanted to for the demo, which was a login for admin, allowing the admin to view and edit flights, and saving the edited
data in a serialized file.  This meeting took longer than expected, but was ultimately very productive as we had to 
familiarize ourselves with the details of android studio.  All the remaining parts of the app that need to be implemented are
variations on the code we have already written for the demo.  As our demo is tomorrow after our CSC207 lab, we decided to
have a brief meeting before the lab to get Darshan up to speed on our progress and to discuss next steps.  As a result
of these back-to-back meetings, no team member was assigned any work to complete for the next meeting.

Next meeting scheduled for 12/1/15

Minutes for Planning Meeting 12/1/15:
The demo went well and we were able to answer all the questions easily.  We also managed to fix the problem where some of
our textviews and edittexts were squished together with help from the TA.  Harry reported that instructions would be
posted tonight on how to share the android studio project with other team members so we aren't stuck working on only
Adam's computer.  Our next meeting to try and finish most of the app will be on 12/4/15.  Until we are able to share the 
app, we will not assign tasks to be completed as of yet.  They will be assigned over our facebook group.

Next meeting scheduled for 12/4/15
